Spent alot of today messing with tkinter building a GUI for the calorie tracker. So far i've managed to implement the following features:

1) Add foods into .csv file
2) Display the contents of the .csv file within the widget (that automatically updates when you add a new item)
    a) also included a manual refresh button on the top right panel incase manual changes are made directly in the .csv file


To do: 
Include some data visualisation?

Other Notes: 
main.ipynb will become redudnant in the future as its applications are no longer necessary
add_to_dat.ipynb will also become redundant in the future.
It is likely that both these files will be deleted in the near future along with the corresponding food_dat.csv file.
